1. Purpose / motivation 
-----------------------

The K(inematic)L(ikelihood)Fitter is a library for kinematic fitting
using a likelihood approach. It is primarily developed for the case of
top quark reconstruction, but it can be easily modified to fit other
processes. KLFitter is experiment independent in a sense that
different experiments can be parameterized.


2.Installation
--------------

2.1 Dependencies 
----------------

KLFitter depends on ROOT and the BAT library. BAT can be obtained
from the following web page:

http://www.mppmu.mpg.de/bat/ 

The current version of BAT is v0.2. Please read the instructions on
how to install and run BAT.

2.2 Installation 
----------------

The installation procedure is simple: 

* Unpack the tarball KLFitter.tar.gz 
* Change into the KLFitter/ directory
* Compile the KLFitter library: 
	"make"

In order to run the ttbar e+jets example do the following:

* Change into the KLFitter/examples/top_e+jets
* Compile the example: 
	"make" 
* Source the setup file: 
	"source setup.sh"
* Run the example: 
	"./runKLFitter.exe" 


3. Class structure
------------------

The KLFitter package is build in a modular way so as to allow the
implementation of different physics processes and parameterizations of
the detector response. All class live in the "KLFitter" namespace. A
reference guide for all classes exists (see
http://physik2.uni-goettingen.de/~kkroeni/KLFitter_v1.2/reference/). The
class structure is as follows:

The central class is "Fitter". It contains objects which describe the
detector (an instance of "DetectorBase"), the input particles (an
instance of "Particles") and the likelihood (an instance of
"LikelihoodBase"). An additional object, an instance of
"Permutations", helps to manage the possible permutations of jets to
quarks, and leptons.

The DetectorBase class summarizes the detector information. It
contains several objects (instances of "ResolutionBase") describing
the parameterizastion of, e.g., energy resolutions for different
particle types. The description of a detector should be done by
creating a class which inherits from DetectorBase. The resolution
objects can be created by additional classes which inherit from
ResolutionBase. An example exists for a dummy detector with Gaussian
energy resolutions.

The Particle class holds containers for different types of particles,
partons (a common class for all quarks and gluons), electron, muons,
neutrinos and boson (a common class for photons and W/Z
bosons). Parton-level or reconstructed particles can be described
here. 

The actual fitting procedure is done in the LikelihoodBase class. This
class inherits from the BAT BCModel class. In order to implement a new
process, the user has to create a class which inherits from
LikelihoodBase. The user has to define the parameters of the fit and
the likelihood itself. An example for e+jets ttbar channel exists. 


4. The fitting procedure
------------------------

4.1 The likelihood
------------------

The KLFitter is based on a likelihood approach. The likelihood
function has to be specified separately for each process. It can
consist of any function defined by the user. Typically, it is the
product of some parameterization of the energy resolution of the
measured jets and leptons, and functions describing the physics
process, such as Breit-Wigner functions, matrix elements, etc. 

In case of semileptonic ttbar events, the likelihood the product of
four quark energy resolution functions, one lepton energy resolution
function and the Breit-Wigner functions of the W boson
masses. Optionally, the Breit-Wigner functions of the top quarks can
be used or, if no explicit dependence on the top mass is aimed at, a
Gaussian term for the difference of the two invariant masses can be
used. 

In this example, the parameters which are estimated are: 
a) the energies of the four jets
b) the energy of the charged lepton
c) the z-component of the neutrino momentum

Other parameters can easily be added. 

4.2 Optimization 
----------------

Optimization is done using the methods provided by BAT. By default,
the optimization method used is TMinuit.

4.3 Marginalization
-------------------

Marginalization is done using the methods provided by BAT. By default,
this method is Markov Chain Monte Carlo. 

4.4 Default analysis
--------------------

In the default analysis a Markov chain is run to coarsly sample the
parameter space and locate a global maximum. Minuit is then used to
find the maximum with a greater precision. 


5. Using the KLFitter
---------------------

5.1 Setting the measured quantities
-----------------------------------

The measured quantities are the 4-vectors of four jets and one charged
lepton, as well as the missing transverse energy (although the latter
is not used yet). An object of type Particles is passed to the Fitter
object. The input quantities can either be set by defining
TLorentzVectors and adding them to Particles object, or by using an
interface. An example for a Root interface exists which reads the data
from a flat Root tree.

5.2 Combinatorics
-----------------

The association of jets with partons and of reconstructed and parton
level leptons leads to several possible combinations. The class
Permutations calculates a table with all possible permutations. A
specific combination (index) can be set by the user,

int KLFitter::Permutations::SetPermutation(int index). 

In case interchanging two (or three) particles leaves the likelihood
invariant two (three) indices can be defined which are interchangeable
(for example for hadronically decaying W bosons). The corresponding
permutations are removed from the table. The indices can be set via

int InvariantPartonPermutations(int index1, int index2, int index3 = -1). 


6. How to run KLFitter - an example
-----------------------------------

A commented example on how to run KLFitter is provided with the code.
